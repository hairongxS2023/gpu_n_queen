To run the original (sequential) version of the code, make run_vector.
To run the final version of the GA, make run_gpu_v2. 
To adjust the number of threads, you will need to change the NUM_THREADS defined at the top. Currently, it's workable for 128 threads and 256 threads.

All of the implementation is done on ECE cluster 020.
